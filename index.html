<p>Roses are a quintessential gift on Valentine's Day, and meaning has been attached to the popular flower for generations. But what does the rose actually signify? And does that meaning change with the color?</p>
<p>Red roses are the most popular gift for Valentine's Day because they represent love and beauty. Giving someone a pink rose means that you admire them. Yellow, meanwhile, depending on who you give it to, can mean friendship or infidelity.</p>
